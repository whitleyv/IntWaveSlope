# IntWaveSlope

Run files and analysis of LES Oceananigans.jl simulations with planar topographic slope using IBM and mode 1 forced internal wave. 

Directory with simulations.

Directory with analysis including plots, dissipation calcualtions, intrusion heights, and tracer weighting.

Directory with contour movie scripts, both 2D and 3D using CairoMakie and GLMakie.

Directory with data from analysis scripts.

Directory with Julia Notebooks with some worked out reflection and parameter explanations.

Parameter file for varying velocity, stratification, etc. in simulations, as well as holding other params constant.
